# wateringhole
Watering Hole is a repository of [WATER-compatible](https://github.com/refraction-networking/water-rs) protocols that should all be signed by trusted parties. This allows tools that trust a given implementation to fetch new transports and test them, potentially automatically.

To add your own protocol, please fork this repository and open a pull request. The Lantern team and any outside collaborators from the WATER team will review it and approve it or request revisions accordingly. You also should shoot us your public key and should sign your protocol with the associated private key. Please ensure binaries are tracked with [git lfs](https://git-lfs.com/).

For more background on WATER, please see the [WATER paper](https://www.petsymposium.org/foci/2024/foci-2024-0003.pdf).
